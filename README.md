# LobChallenge
This was created using Python 3. The Lob library needs to be installed in order to work. That can be done using:

`pip install lob`

Simply run the program and enter the inputs required.

`python lobChallenge.py`

The program checks for valid input (correct state abbreviation, correct zipcode, correct message length), then finds a senator from the input area, and then sends the letter to the senator.
